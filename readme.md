^^^^^^^^^^^
how antibodies specifically interact with their antigens can help find drug and vaccine pairs. 


Thoughts:
^^^^^^^^^
-what is residue in spatial proximity?

- The immune system develop B cells that secrete antibodies 

- Those B-cells secrete antibodies that neutralized the impact of a pathogen

- epiptope(antibody) -- binds to -- paratope (pathogen)

- antigen is a molecular structure that is present on the surface of the pathogen that binds to the antigen of an antibody or B-Cell receptor

- not only we need to find antigen-antibody pair we need to detect where are the paratope and the epitope

- paratopes are easy to find in sequence (sequential form), but in contrast epitopes are a bit tricky they are conformational (distal in sequence, but close in 3D)
  
- many epitope-paratope pair prediction rely on 
1. Docking, which estimate the most likely conformations of a complex based on complemetarity(geometric, chemical, energetic) between the individual proteins in many possible poses
